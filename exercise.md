## Organisation

### Duration

This task is designed to take around **20** minutes, with ten minutes for feedback/review at the end.

### Team

For this task, work with another member of your cohort.

## Learning objectives

- **Discuss** fundamental principles of programming
- **Define** key programming terms (e.g. variable, conditional, iteration, function, algorithm)
- **Use** pseudocode to design algorithms

## Brief

For each of the following tasks, write a **pseudocode algorithm** for the solution.

1. Identifying the smallest value out of three separate values
2. Identifying the largest value from a list of values
3. Sorting a list of values in ascending order
